The left-hand navigation menu now contains the following options: ① Accounts Overview (default dashboard view), ② Open New Account, ③ Transfer Funds, ④ Bill Pay, ⑤ Request Loan, ⑥ Update Contact Info, ⑦ Manage Cards, ⑧ Investments, ⑨ Account Statements, ⑩ Security Settings, ⑪ Support Center, and ⑫ Log Out.

# Functional specification

## login
The login page contains a login form with two required input fields—Email/Username and Password—along with a "Sign In" button and a "Forgot Password?" link. Email must be a valid email format and password must be at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character. When the user submits the form, the system securely validates the provided credentials against the registered-user database. If authentication succeeds, the system flashes "Signed in successfully." and redirects the user to the Accounts Overview page; if it fails, it shows "Incorrect email or password. Please try again," clears the password field, and allows another attempt.

## register
The registration page presents a comprehensive sign-up form with required inputs for First Name, Last Name, Street Address, City, State (dropdown with all US states), ZIP Code, Phone Number, Social Security Number, Username (email format), Password, and Confirm Password, plus a "Register" button. The system enforces specific validation constraints: Username must be a valid email format, Phone Number must follow the format (123) 456-7890 with automatic formatting, ZIP Code must be 5 digits or 5+4 format (12345 or 12345-6789), SSN must follow the format 123-45-6789 with automatic formatting, Password must be at least 8 characters, and Confirm Password must match the Password field. On submission, the system validates field completeness, pattern conformance, and password match. Success produces "Account created successfully — please sign in," then redirects to the login page, otherwise specific field-level errors are displayed for correction.

## accounts_overview
The dashboard displays a table of all customer accounts, each row showing Account Number (clickable), Account Type, and Current Balance, with a footer totaling all balances. Rows are ordered by descending balance. If no accounts exist, the table is replaced with “You have no accounts yet.” and a prominent “Open an Account” shortcut. Retrieval failures trigger the message “Unable to load account information. Please try again later.” and are logged for support.

## open_new_account
This page contains an account-opening form that requires Account Type (Checking or Savings), Initial Deposit Amount, Funding Source Account, and an “Open Account” button. The system validates the fields, enforces minimum deposits, checks funding-account balance, creates the new account, debits the source account, and shows “Account created successfully.” plus the new account number and starting balance; validation failures produce clear error messages and highlight the offending fields.

## transfer_funds
The transfer page presents a form requiring Transfer Amount, Source Account (dropdown), and Destination Account (own account dropdown or external account field with Confirm Account Number), plus a “Transfer” button. The system validates all inputs, compares duplicate account numbers for a match, confirms sufficient source funds, and verifies destination-account validity. Successful transfers immediately update balances and show “Transfer completed successfully.” with a transaction ID; failures show contextual errors such as “Insufficient funds” or “Invalid destination account.”

## payments
The bill-payment page houses a payment form with fields for Payee Name, Street Address, City, State, ZIP Code, Phone Number, Payee Account Number plus Confirm Account Number, Payment Amount, and Source Account (dropdown), finished by a “Pay” button. On submission, the system validates all entries, enforces account-number match, checks available funds, executes the payment, returns “Payment submitted successfully.” with a reference code, and updates balances. Errors (e.g., “Account numbers do not match,” “Insufficient funds”) are displayed inline and the form remains editable.

## request_loan
The loan-application page presents a form requiring Loan Amount, Down-Payment Amount, and Collateral Account, followed by an “Apply” button. The system ensures numeric correctness, that down payment < loan amount, adequate collateral value, and sufficient funds for the down payment. An automated credit-underwriting engine evaluates historical data. On approval, the system debits the down payment, earmarks collateral, creates the loan account, and shows “Loan approved and created successfully.” with account number and terms. On denial, it displays “Loan application denied” plus specific reasons.

## update_contact_info
The customer profile page offers an editable form pre-filled with First Name, Last Name, Street Address, City, State, ZIP Code, and Phone Number, plus an “Update Profile” button. Submission triggers validation of each entry (format and completeness). Success produces “Profile updated successfully.” and refreshes the data; failures highlight invalid fields and display an inline error banner.

## manage_cards
The Manage Cards page contains two separate forms presented in stacked cards.The card request form includes Card Type (Debit or Credit), Account to Link, Shipping Address, and a “Request Card” button. When submitted, the system checks that the address is complete, verifies the selected account’s standing, opens a card-request ticket, and shows “Card request submitted successfully.” with a tracking ID.The card controls form includes Select Existing Card (dropdown), New Spending Limit, Travel Notice (optional dates and destinations), Card Status (Active or Frozen), and an “Update Controls” button. The system validates numeric limits, date ranges, and allowable card-status transitions. Successful updates display “Card controls updated successfully.”; validation failures (for example, a limit above policy) appear inline, and the form stays editable.

## investments
The Investments page is a multi-section workspace.The portfolio snapshot is a read-only panel that shows current fund holdings, market value, and unrealised gain or loss.The trade funds form includes Action (Buy or Sell), Fund Symbol (autocomplete), Quantity, Funding or Destination Account (dropdown), and an “Execute Trade” button. The system checks that the symbol exists, quantity is greater than zero, and that the customer has sufficient buying power or share balance. A successful submission executes a same-day trade, updates holdings, and displays “Trade executed successfully.” with an order ID; validation failures appear inline.The recurring investment plan form includes Fund Symbol, Contribution Amount, Frequency (Weekly or Monthly), Start Date, Funding Account, and a “Create Plan” button. The system validates that the start date is in the future, the contribution meets the minimum, and that the funding account has adequate balance. Success stores the schedule and shows “Plan created successfully.”; errors highlight the problematic fields (for example, “Start date must be in the future”).

## account_statements
The Statements page provides two coordinated forms displayed side by side.The generate statement form includes Statement Period (month-and-year or custom date range), Account (dropdown), and a “Generate Statement” button. The system validates the dates and retrieves the relevant transactions. On success it displays “Statement generated successfully.”; if generation fails it shows “Unable to generate statement — please try again later.”The e-statement preference form includes a checkbox to opt into paperless statements, an Email Address field, and a “Save Preference” button. The system validates the email address; success displays “e-Statement preference updated.”, while a failure highlights the email field with guidance.

## security_settings
The Security Settings page contains a single form under a collapsible panel.The change password form contains Current Password, New Password, Confirm New Password, and a “Change Password” button. The system verifies the current password, enforces a strong-password policy, checks the match, and updates credentials, returning “Password changed successfully.”. Validation errors highlight the appropriate fields.

## support_center
The Support Center page integrates two communication forms.The secure message form includes Subject, Category (dropdown: Account, Technical, Security, Other), Message Body (rich text), optional Attachment, and a “Send Message” button. The system checks subject length, ensures a message body is present, and validates attachment types. On success it shows “Message sent successfully.” with a ticket ID; failures display inline guidance. The schedule callback form includes Reason for Call (dropdown), Preferred Date, Preferred Time Window, Phone Number (pre-filled but editable), and a “Request Callback” button. The system ensures the date is at least the next business day and validates the phone number format. Success returns “Callback request submitted.” and sends an email confirmation; validation errors are shown inline.
